- See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for upgrade information

## Limitations

- **No Compressed File Support**: romaudit_cli works only with uncompressed ROM files. ZIP, 7Z, RAR, and other compressed formats are not supported. Extract your ROMs before scanning.

## Installation

### Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/romaudit_cli/releases).

### Prerequisites for Building

- Rust 1.75 or later (with edition 2024 support)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/romaudit_cli.git
cd romaudit_cli
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be in `target/release/romaudit_cli` (or `romaudit_cli.exe` on Windows).

## Usage

### Requirements

- A `.dat` or `.xml` file (ROM database) in the current directory
- ROM files to be organized (can be in subdirectories)
- **Important**: ROM files must be uncompressed. The tool does not support ZIP, 7Z, RAR, or other compressed formats.

### Basic Usage

1. **Prepare your ROMs**:
   - Extract all compressed files (ZIP, 7Z, RAR, etc.)
   - romaudit_cli only processes uncompressed ROM files

2. Place the romaudit_cli executable in a directory containing:
   - A `.dat` or `.xml` file (ROM database)
   - Uncompressed ROM files to be organized

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./romaudit_cli
   ```

4. The program will:
   - Automatically detect and use the first `.dat` or `.xml` file found
   - Scan all uncompressed files in the current directory and subdirectories
   - Match them against the DAT/XML file
   - Organize them according to the rules
   - Generate detailed logs
   - Handle interruptions gracefully (Ctrl+C saves progress)

### Directory Structure

After running, your directory will be organized as:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ roms/                    # Organized ROM files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Game Name/          # Multi-part games in folders
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ disk1.bin
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ disk2.bin
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Single Game.rom     # Single ROMs directly in roms/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [BIOS] System/      # System files always in folders
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ bios.bin
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                   # Detailed audit logs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ have.txt           # List of found ROMs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ missing.txt        # List of missing ROMs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared.txt         # ROMs shared between games
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ folders.txt        # Games stored in subfolders
â”œâ”€â”€ duplicates1/           # Duplicate files (if any)
â”œâ”€â”€ unknown1/              # Unrecognized files (if any)
â”œâ”€â”€ rom_db.json           # Persistent ROM database
â””â”€â”€ your_file.dat/.xml    # Original DAT/XML file
```

## Organization Rules

romaudit_cli follows these intelligent organization rules:

**Key Principle**: Folders are used ONLY when necessary - either for multiple files or to prevent naming conflicts.

1. **Multiple ROM Files** â†’ Always use folders
   - Example: `roms/Game Name/disk1.bin`, `roms/Game Name/disk2.bin`

2. **Single ROM (matching name)** â†’ Direct in roms/
   - Example: `roms/Sonic the Hedgehog.md`
   - Example: `roms/[BIOS] Nintendo 64DD Drive Controller (Japan) (Development) (1998-06-16).bin`

3. **Single ROM (different name)** â†’ Use folder
   - Example: `roms/Memory (Japan)/MEMORY.ASF`

4. **ROMs with paths** â†’ Preserve folder structure
   - Example: `roms/Game/folder/file.bin`

## Configuration

romaudit_cli uses sensible defaults but is fully configurable. You can modify:

### Directory Names
```rust
config.rom_dir = "my_roms".to_string();
config.logs_dir = "audit_logs".to_string();
```

### Other Settings
- Database filename
- Buffer size for hashing
- Duplicate/unknown folder prefixes
- Stop words for name comparison

Note: Version 1.6.1 simplified the organization logic. BIOS and system files now follow the same rules as regular games - folders are only created when there are multiple ROM files or name mismatches.

## DAT/XML File Support

romaudit_cli automatically detects and supports various file formats:

### No-Intro Style DAT
```xml
<game name="Game Name">
    <rom name="game.rom" size="524288" crc="12345678" md5="..." sha1="..."/>
</game>
```

### MAME Style XML
```xml
<machine name="Game Name">
    <rom name="game.rom" size="524288" crc="12345678" md5="..." sha1="...">
    </rom>
</machine>
```

The tool automatically detects whether you're using a `.dat` or `.xml` file and handles files up to 45MB+ efficiently (tested with MAME XML files).

## Advanced Features

### Persistent ROM Database

romaudit_cli maintains a `rom_db.json` file that tracks:
- Which games you have
- ROM locations and filenames
- Hash verification data

This allows for fast incremental scans and historical tracking.

### Shared ROM Detection

Some ROMs are identical across multiple games. romaudit_cli:
- Detects these shared ROMs
- Creates separate copies for each game
- Documents sharing relationships in logs

### Smart Name Matching

The name matching algorithm:
- Handles case differences
- Ignores common punctuation variations
- Recognizes region/version suffixes
- Detects significant name mismatches requiring folders

### Graceful Interruption

If you need to stop the tool:
- Press Ctrl+C for clean shutdown
- Progress is automatically saved to `rom_db.json`
- Run the tool again to continue from where you left off

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-disk Game
```
Input: diskA.bin, diskB.bin (for "Final Fantasy VII")
Output: roms/Final Fantasy VII/diskA.bin
         roms/Final Fantasy VII/diskB.bin
```

### Scenario 2: Single BIOS File
```
Input: [BIOS] Nintendo 64DD Drive Controller.bin
Output: roms/[BIOS] Nintendo 64DD Drive Controller.bin
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-file BIOS
```
Input: bios7i.bin, firmware.bin (for "[BIOS] Nintendo DSi")
Output: roms/[BIOS] Nintendo DSi/bios7i.bin
         roms/[BIOS] Nintendo DSi/firmware.bin
```

### Scenario 4: Mismatched Names
```
Input: MEMORY.ASF (for game "Memory (Japan)")
Output: roms/Memory (Japan)/MEMORY.ASF
```

## Performance

- **Efficient Hashing**: Uses 1MB buffer for optimal performance
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback during long operations
- **Large File Support**: Adaptive buffering for large XML files (8MB buffer for files >10MB)
- **Direct File Access**: Working with uncompressed files provides faster processing
- **Persistent Database**: Speeds up subsequent scans
- **Graceful Interruption**: Clean shutdown preserves progress

## Troubleshooting

### No DAT/XML file found
Ensure you have a `.dat` or `.xml` file in the current directory. The tool automatically detects and uses the first one it finds.

### Files not being matched
- Check that your DAT/XML file uses supported hash types (CRC32, MD5, SHA1)
- **Ensure ROM files are uncompressed** - ZIP, 7Z, RAR files are not supported
- Verify file integrity if ROMs are not being recognized

### Compressed ROM files
romaudit_cli does not support compressed files. Extract all ROMs from their archives before running the tool. Common compressed formats that need extraction:
- ZIP files
- 7Z files  
- RAR files
- GZ/GZIP files
- Any other archive format

### Permission errors
Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where romaudit_cli is running.

### Large collections
For very large collections, the initial scan may take time. The tool shows progress when parsing large XML files (45MB+). Subsequent scans will be faster due to the persistent database.

### Process interruption
If you need to stop the tool, press Ctrl+C. The tool will save its progress and you can continue later by running it again.

## FAQ

### Does romaudit_cli support compressed ROM files?
**No.** romaudit_cli only works with uncompressed ROM files. You must extract all ROMs from ZIP, 7Z, RAR, or other archive formats before scanning. This is by design to ensure accurate hash verification and file organization.

### What's the difference between DAT and XML files?
Both contain ROM databases. DAT files are typically used by No-Intro, while XML files are commonly used by MAME. romaudit_cli automatically detects and handles both formats.

### Can it handle large MAME XML files?
**Yes.** Version 1.6.2 includes optimizations for large XML files, including adaptive buffering and progress indicators for files over 10MB.

### Why doesn't it support compressed files?
Working with uncompressed files ensures:
- Accurate hash verification
- Proper file organization
- Better performance
- Simpler codebase

### What file formats are supported?
Any uncompressed ROM file format (.nes, .snes, .md, .gb, .gba, .n64, .iso, .bin, etc.) that matches entries in your DAT/XML file.

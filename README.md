## Installation

### Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/romaudit_cli/releases).

### Prerequisites for Building

- Rust 1.75 or later (with edition 2024 support)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/romaudit_cli.git
cd romaudit_cli
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be in `target/release/romaudit_cli` (or `romaudit_cli.exe` on Windows).

## Usage

### Requirements

- A `.dat` or `.xml` file (ROM database) in the current directory
- ROM files to be organized (can be in subdirectories)
- **Important**: ROM files must be uncompressed. The tool does not support ZIP, 7Z, RAR, or other compressed formats.

### Basic Usage

1. **Prepare your ROMs**:
   - Extract all compressed files (ZIP, 7Z, RAR, etc.)
   - romaudit_cli only processes uncompressed ROM files

2. Place the romaudit_cli executable in a directory containing:
   - A `.dat` or `.xml` file (ROM database)
   - Uncompressed ROM files to be organized

3. Run the program (no configuration needed):
   ```bash
   ./romaudit_cli
   ```

4. The program will:
   - Automatically detect and use the first `.dat` or `.xml` file found
   - Scan all uncompressed files in the current directory and subdirectories
   - Match them against the DAT/XML file
   - Organize them according to the rules
   - Generate detailed logs
   - Handle interruptions gracefully (Ctrl+C saves progress)

**Note**: No `config.toml` required! The tool uses sensible defaults. See [Configuration](#configuration) if you want to customize settings.

### Directory Structure

After running, your directory will be organized as:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ roms/                    # Organized ROM files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Game Name/          # Multi-part games in folders
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ disk1.bin
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ disk2.bin
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Single Game.rom     # Single ROMs directly in roms/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [BIOS] System/      # System files always in folders
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ bios.bin
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                   # Detailed audit logs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ have.txt           # List of found ROMs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ missing.txt        # List of missing ROMs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared.txt         # ROMs shared between games
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ folders.txt        # Games stored in subfolders
â”œâ”€â”€ duplicates1/           # Duplicate files (if any)
â”œâ”€â”€ unknown1/              # Unrecognized files (if any)
â”œâ”€â”€ rom_db.json           # Persistent ROM database
â””â”€â”€ your_file.dat/.xml    # Original DAT/XML file
```

## Organization Rules

romaudit_cli follows these intelligent organization rules:

**Key Principle**: Folders are used ONLY when necessary - either for multiple files or to prevent naming conflicts.

1. **Multiple ROM Files** â†’ Always use folders
   - Example: `roms/Game Name/disk1.bin`, `roms/Game Name/disk2.bin`

2. **Single ROM (matching name)** â†’ Direct in roms/
   - Example: `roms/Sonic the Hedgehog.md`
   - Example: `roms/[BIOS] Nintendo 64DD Drive Controller (Japan) (Development) (1998-06-16).bin`

3. **Single ROM (different name)** â†’ Use folder
   - Example: `roms/Memory (Japan)/MEMORY.ASF`

4. **ROMs with paths** â†’ Preserve folder structure
   - Example: `roms/Game/folder/file.bin`

## Configuration

romaudit_cli uses sensible defaults but is fully configurable. 

### Default Configuration (No File Needed)
The tool works out-of-the-box without any configuration file, using these defaults:
- ROM directory: `roms/`
- Logs directory: `logs/`
- Database file: `rom_db.json`
- Buffer size: 1MB
- Duplicate prefix: `duplicates`
- Unknown prefix: `unknown`

### Custom Configuration (Optional)
You can optionally create a `config.toml` file to override defaults:

```toml
# config.toml (optional)
rom_dir = "my_roms"
logs_dir = "audit_logs"
db_file = "my_database.json"
```

**Note**: The config file is completely optional. The tool runs perfectly with default settings.

## DAT/XML File Support

romaudit_cli automatically detects and supports various file formats:

### No-Intro Style DAT
```xml
<game name="Game Name">
    <rom name="game.rom" size="524288" crc="12345678" md5="..." sha1="..."/>
</game>
```

### MAME Style XML
```xml
<machine name="Game Name">
    <rom name="game.rom" size="524288" crc="12345678" md5="..." sha1="...">
    </rom>
</machine>
```

### MAME DAT Types (Auto-detected)

The tool automatically detects and handles three MAME DAT types:

1. **Non-Merged Sets**:
   - Each game is completely self-contained
   - All ROMs (including shared ones) are duplicated for each game
   - Ideal for: Individual game distribution, arcade cabinets
   - Space usage: Highest (2-3x original size)

2. **Split Sets**:
   - Clone games only contain unique ROMs
   - Clones depend on parent ROMs to function
   - Ideal for: Complete collections with space constraints
   - Space usage: Medium (more efficient than non-merged)

3. **Merged Sets**:
   - Clone ROMs are stored in parent game folders
   - No separate clone folders created
   - Ideal for: Maximum space efficiency
   - Space usage: Lowest

The tool automatically detects the DAT type from the header and organizes accordingly, preventing unnecessary duplication for split and merged sets.

## Advanced Features

### Persistent ROM Database

romaudit_cli maintains a `rom_db.json` file that tracks:
- Which games you have
- ROM locations and filenames
- Hash verification data

This allows for fast incremental scans and historical tracking.

### Shared ROM Detection

Some ROMs are identical across multiple games. romaudit_cli:
- Detects these shared ROMs
- Creates separate copies for each game
- Documents sharing relationships in logs

### Smart Name Matching

The name matching algorithm:
- Handles case differences
- Ignores common punctuation variations
- Recognizes region/version suffixes
- Detects significant name mismatches requiring folders

### Graceful Interruption

If you need to stop the tool:
- Press Ctrl+C for clean shutdown
- Progress is automatically saved to `rom_db.json`
- Run the tool again to continue from where you left off

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-disk Game
```
Input: diskA.bin, diskB.bin (for "Final Fantasy VII")
Output: roms/Final Fantasy VII/diskA.bin
         roms/Final Fantasy VII/diskB.bin
```

### Scenario 2: Single BIOS File
```
Input: [BIOS] Nintendo 64DD Drive Controller.bin
Output: roms/[BIOS] Nintendo 64DD Drive Controller.bin
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-file BIOS
```
Input: bios7i.bin, firmware.bin (for "[BIOS] Nintendo DSi")
Output: roms/[BIOS] Nintendo DSi/bios7i.bin
         roms/[BIOS] Nintendo DSi/firmware.bin
```

### Scenario 4: Mismatched Names
```
Input: MEMORY.ASF (for game "Memory (Japan)")
Output: roms/Memory (Japan)/MEMORY.ASF
```

## Performance

- **Efficient Hashing**: Uses 1MB buffer for optimal performance  
- **Single-pass scanning**: Calculates hashes only once per file (v1.6.3+)
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback with ETA for long operations
- **Large File Support**: Adaptive buffering for large XML files (8MB buffer for files >10MB)
- **Direct File Access**: Working with uncompressed files provides faster processing
- **Persistent Database**: Speeds up subsequent scans
- **Graceful Interruption**: Clean shutdown preserves progress

**Note**: For large MAME collections:
- **Non-merged sets**: Ensure you have 2-3x the ROM size in free space
- **Split sets**: More space-efficient, clones depend on parents
- **Merged sets**: Most space-efficient, all variants in parent folder
- The tool automatically detects your DAT type and organizes accordingly

## Troubleshooting

### No DAT/XML file found
Ensure you have a `.dat` or `.xml` file in the current directory. The tool automatically detects and uses the first one it finds.

### Files not being matched
- Check that your DAT/XML file uses supported hash types (CRC32, MD5, SHA1)
- **Ensure ROM files are uncompressed** - ZIP, 7Z, RAR files are not supported
- Verify file integrity if ROMs are not being recognized

### Compressed ROM files
romaudit_cli does not support compressed files. Extract all ROMs from their archives before running the tool. Common compressed formats that need extraction:
- ZIP files
- 7Z files  
- RAR files
- GZ/GZIP files
- Any other archive format

### Permission errors
Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where romaudit_cli is running.

### Large collections
For very large collections, the initial scan may take time. The tool shows progress with ETA (v1.6.3+). Subsequent scans will be faster due to the persistent database.

### Disk space issues
MAME collections space requirements depend on DAT type:
- **Non-merged sets**: Require 2-3x original size (all ROMs duplicated)
- **Split sets**: More efficient (clones don't duplicate parent ROMs)
- **Merged sets**: Most efficient (clones stored with parents)

If you're running out of space:
1. Use split or merged DATs instead of non-merged
2. Organize in smaller batches
3. Check available disk space before organizing large collections

### Process interruption
If you need to stop the tool, press Ctrl+C. The tool will save its progress and you can continue later by running it again.

## FAQ

### Does romaudit_cli require a configuration file?
**No.** The tool works perfectly with built-in defaults. You only need to create a `config.toml` if you want to customize settings like directory names or buffer sizes.

### Does romaudit_cli support compressed ROM files?
**No.** romaudit_cli only works with uncompressed ROM files. You must extract all ROMs from ZIP, 7Z, RAR, or other archive formats before scanning. This is by design to ensure accurate hash verification and file organization.

### What's the difference between DAT and XML files?
Both contain ROM databases. DAT files are typically used by No-Intro, while XML files are commonly used by MAME. romaudit_cli automatically detects and handles both formats.

### Can it handle large MAME XML files?
**Yes.** Version 1.6.2 includes optimizations for large XML files, including adaptive buffering and progress indicators for files over 10MB.

### Why doesn't it support compressed files?
Working with uncompressed files ensures:
- Accurate hash verification
- Proper file organization
- Better performance
- Simpler codebase

### What file formats are supported?
Any uncompressed ROM file format (.nes, .snes, .md, .gb, .gba, .n64, .iso, .bin, etc.) that matches entries in your DAT/XML file.
